**Objet :** The Intrepid journal is corrupted at its root

The Intrepid journal, which was once free and independant, is now controlled by a multinational company. This company uses the journal notoriety to insidiously orient investigators towards their concurrent activities, and discredit them.

I was about to download files, containing contracts between the journal admins and this company, but you spoiled the party. Now the application is shutdown, and my backdoor is useless. If you do not trust me, finish the investigation, reverse my logic, and decrypt the file at `/var/www/html/app/uploads/38111a8e12a77b820a9a3373a3f2810645a36e0e/38111a8e12a77b820a9a3373a3f2810645a36e0e`. You'll see that I am not a liar.
